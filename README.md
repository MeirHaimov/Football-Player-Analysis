# Football-Player-Analysis
 This project analyzes FIFA player data from 2015 to 2020 to identify distinguishing factors between top and average players. It also develops predictive models to forecast the success of young players based on their attributes and evaluates the impact of playing for big clubs versus smaller clubs on Player development.
Tools used:

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn)
SQL for querying and managing player data

Key Objectives:
Distinguishing Top Players: Analyze player attributes and performance metrics to identify characteristics that differentiate top players from average players in the FIFA dataset.
Prediction of Young Players' Success: Develop predictive models to estimate the future success of young players. These models take into account factors like player skill, age, and previous performance.
Impact of Club Size: Investigate whether playing for a big club has more influence on a player's development compared to playing for a smaller club.
Data and Tools Used:
FIFA Dataset (2015–2020): The dataset contains player attributes such as skill ratings, potential, age, position, and club information.
SQL: Used for querying the dataset and performing data aggregation and transformation.
NumPy and Pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and performing various statistical operations to analyze trends in player performance.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Utilized for data visualization, to create graphs and charts that help identify patterns and insights.
Approach and Methodology:
Data Preprocessing:

Imported the FIFA dataset and cleaned it by removing missing values and irrelevant columns.
Aggregated player statistics by club size and age group to help identify patterns in performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of key player attributes like skill level, age, and position.
Visualized the relationships between these variables and player success using bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features to enhance the prediction models, such as average skill level, potential growth, and club size.
Normalized player attributes to ensure consistency across different scales of measurement (e.g., skill ratings and age).
Predictive Modeling:

Developed multiple machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict the success of young players based on their current attributes.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Analysis of Club Size Impact:

Investigated whether playing for a big club (e.g., top-tier teams) has a greater impact on a player’s development than playing for a smaller club.
Used statistical tests (e.g., t-tests) to compare player performance between big and small clubs.
Results and Findings:
Top Players: We found that top players typically had higher skill ratings, potential, and experience compared to average players.
Young Players’ Success: The predictive models showed that a combination of high potential and playing experience significantly impacted a young player's chances of success.
Club Size Influence: The analysis revealed that playing for a big club did have a positive influence on player development, but the impact was more pronounced for certain positions and skill sets. Smaller clubs still played a crucial role in developing talent, especially for players with high potential.
Key Takeaways:
Player Attributes: Skill ratings, age, and potential are strong predictors of a player's future success.
Club Influence: While big clubs can accelerate player development, smaller clubs also contribute significantly, especially for players with high potential but less experience.
Modeling Success: Machine learning models can accurately predict player success based on available attributes, providing insights that can guide talent scouting and player development strategies.
